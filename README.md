Physics simulation for colliding discs. Idea:

- Define different disc types (mass, radius, color, etc.)
- Define reactions: decomposition (A -> B + C), combination (A + B -> C), exchange (A + B -> C + D)
- Define compartment with semi-permeable membranes (pending)
- Track state of the simulation with plots and a real-time view
