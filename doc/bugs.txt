Problem: Discs are moving very quickly from outside of the membrane into it, sometimes from very far away
Reason: The main issue is that captureIntruders does a push_back, invalidating the pointers in the intruding discs: 
- parent adds intruder to child (i1) 
- recurse into child 
- child adds intruder to parent (i2) 
- child captures i1, causing a push back 
- i2 is now invalid
- parent captures i2, random ass disc in memory is moved instead of the real intruder
Solution: Added needMemoryForIntruders_ flag for this reason to avoid push_backs that invalidate pointers and reallocate memory 
for intruders before the next simulation update. At the beginning there aren't any pointers to discs_ yet, so .reserve() is save there.
And capturing intruders can be delayed, as long as they are detected they take part in the collision handling

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Problem: Discs move seemingly without collision detection through others
Reason: captureIntruders() was called before disc-disc collision detection, clearing intrudingDiscs_ too early so that they couldn't take part in the collision detection
Solution: Moved captureIntruders() to the end of bimolecular update

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Problem: Individual discs are suddenly very far from their containing membrane 
Reason: The bimolecular (and other) reactions updated disc properties (mass, radius, etc.) in-place after collision detection, but before collision resolution. 
This caused nonsensical velocity updates during collision resolution.
Solution: 
- All reaction methods destroy their educts and create new discs as products
- Move bimolecular reaction handling after disc collision handling. 
Not sure if both are necessary, maybe the second would have been enough, but it makes sense to prevent discs from changing physical properties mid-frame.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Problem: Reaction probabilities had order-based biases
Reason: 
- If transformation/combination is checked before decomposition/exchange, they occur with higher probability 
- For bimolecular reactions, non-identical keys [e1, e2] were inserted twice with [e2, e1] as well, whereas identical keys weren't
Solution:
- Combined all uni-/bimolecular reactions into single maps, random shuffled all reactions, randomly selected starting point
- Used std::minmax for bimolecular reaction map keys
