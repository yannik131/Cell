- mitochondrium produces about 10M ATP molecules from ADP per second
- Protein synthesis: 2M ATP/s, Transport: 1M ATP/s, DNA/RNA Synthesis: 1M ATP/s 

- mitochondrium produces exactly enough atp per second to satisfy the cell
- after a fixed time of atp consumption, the nucleus goes through the 6 cell division phases
- the stages are animated accordingly
- at the end the cell divides
- done
